          This is your potential, what your body could lose if itâ€™s in fat-burning
          mode. But that depends on getting your metabolism working with you, not
          against you.
          <br />
          <br />
          Low energy, stubborn cravings, and slow progress usually mean your body
          is still burning sugar instead of fat â€” and that keeps weight loss stuck.
        </>

          With your numbers, results could show up even faster than expected, but
          only if your metabolism is dialed in and youâ€™re burning fat, not sugar.
