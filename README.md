### Detailed Structure and Implementation

I've organized the codebase following a feature-first architecture, which improves maintainability and scalability:

- **Context Layer**: The application uses React Context API (`FormProvider.tsx`) for global state management, avoiding prop drilling and maintaining clean component interfaces.
- **Component Structure**:
  - **Shared Components**: Reusable UI components (TextInput, SliderInput, RadioGroup, DropdownInput) that are styled consistently and follow accessibility best practices.
  - **Feature-specific Components**: Each feature (form, results, sales) is isolated in its own directory with its unique components.
- **Data Persistence**: Form data is automatically persisted in localStorage, allowing users to return to their session without losing progress.
- **Routing Implementation**: React Router v7 manages navigation between the form, results, and sales pages with clean, declarative routing.

This structure makes it easy to:
- Add new form fields or modify existing ones
- Create additional result cards or customize existing ones
- Adjust the sales page content and layout
- Integrate with backend APIs for data submission

---

## How It Works

- **FormPage:** Users fill out details like gender, body fat %, BMI, calorie target, water intake, weight loss rate, and days to see results. The form is controlled and only submits when all fields are valid.
- **ResultsPage:** Displays a stepper with progress, navigation, and cards that use the user's answers to give feedback. Fully responsive and accessible.
- **SalesPage:** Highlights the offer with a sticky CTA, comparison table, benefits, trust signals, and a countdown timer. All images have alt text, and interactive elements are accessible.

### Implementation Details

1. **Form Validation & User Experience**:
   - Real-time validation with clear error messages
   - Required field indicators
   - Field-specific validation (numeric ranges, required selections)
   - Intuitive UI controls (sliders for percentage fields, dropdowns for limited options)
   - Smooth transitions between form sections

2. **Results Calculation Logic**:
   - Results are calculated based on user input using evidence-based formulas
   - Each result card focuses on a specific aspect of the user's health journey
   - Data visualization helps users understand their projected progress
   - Interactive elements allow users to see how different inputs affect outcomes

3. **Conversion Optimization**:
   - Clear call-to-action buttons with consistent styling
   - Urgency elements (countdown timer) to encourage immediate action
   - Benefit-focused content that addresses user pain points
   - Trust indicators strategically placed throughout the sales flow
   - Mobile-optimized purchase process

---

## Accessibility

- All form fields use ARIA labels and roles
- Buttons and links work with keyboard navigation
- Color contrast and font sizes are accessible
- Images have descriptive alt text

### Advanced Accessibility Features
- **Focus management**: Proper tab order and focus trapping in modal components
- **Semantic HTML**: Using appropriate elements for their intended purpose
- **Error handling**: Clear error messages with aria-live regions for screen readers
- **Responsive design**: Ensures accessibility across device sizes
- **Progressive enhancement**: Core functionality works without JavaScript
- **Color-blind friendly**: Color scheme tested for various types of color blindness

---

## Styling

- Tailwind CSS for layout and design
- Inter font via Google Fonts
- Color palette:
  - Primary: `#36BC9F`
  - Accent: `#F75950`
  - Text: `#183B49`, `#13556F`, `#12241F`

### Design System Implementation
- **Consistent spacing**: Using Tailwind's spacing scale throughout the application
- **Typography system**: Standardized heading and body text styles
- **Component variants**: Consistent styling for buttons, inputs, and cards

## Troubleshooting Tests

**React Import Error:**  
If you see `ReferenceError: React is not defined` in tests, check your Babel and Jest configs for the [automatic JSX runtime](https://react.dev/blog/2020/09/22/introducing-the-new-jsx-transform).
You shouldn't need to import React in every file.  
Example configs:

```js
// babel.config.js
module.exports = {
  presets: [
    ['@babel/preset-react', { runtime: 'automatic' }],
    // ...other presets
  ],
};

// jest.config.js
module.exports = {
  transform: {
    '^.+\\.(js|jsx|ts|tsx)$': 'babel-jest',
  },
  // ...other config
};
```
